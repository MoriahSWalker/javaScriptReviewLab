var firstVariable = (32);

// Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
var secondVariable = firstVariable;

// Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
var secondVariable = ("Hello");

// What is the value of firstVariable? Should be "Hello" but I dont know what I'm doing wrong. 
console.log(firstVariable) 

// Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
